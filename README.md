# Modelly

Event-driven data models for a business logic independent of the UI

- Framework agnostic: manage a data outside of UI, you donâ€™t need to touch the UI to run change-dependent logic, for example with React hooks
- Decentralized: split a business logic before components, modules or chunks
- Boilerplate-free: describe the data and flow of working with them

## Install

```sh
npm install modelly
```

or

```sh
yarn add modelly
```

## Usage

### Base example

```ts
import {Channel, Events} from 'modelly'
import * as api from './api'

class User extends Channel {
  displayName?: string
  email?: string

  async fetch() {
    const {displayName, email} = await api.getCurrentUser()
    this.displayName = displayName
    this.email = email
  }
}

const currentUser = new User()

currentUser.on(Events.UPDATE, () => {
  // currentUser is fetched
  // {displayName: '...', email: '...'}
})

currentUser.fetch()
```
